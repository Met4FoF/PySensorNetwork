# PySensorNetwork
This repository contains a class library comprised of a base class and derived subclasses each representing more or less task specific measuring devices which are used in the EMPIR project 17IND12 Metrology for the Factory of the Future. Thus it provides an interface and implementation of the abstraction of sensors and different kinds of measuring devices taking into account the structure and content of the digital calibration certificate (DCC).

The structure of the class model is shown in the following picture.

If you have advices or requests regarding the model or its implementation you are warmly welcome to contact the maintainers or fork this repository and send a pull request with your suggested changes.
